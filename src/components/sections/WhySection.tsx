              This project explores the future of human suffering in a world where Artificial Intelligence is an inescapable, ubiquitous variable. It moves beyond traditional definitions of suffering (disease, scarcity, physical pain) to investigate the emerging existential, psychological, and social challenges of the coming era.
            </p>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              AI will act as both a potential solution to old problems and a catalyst for new, unprecedented forms of human distress. We're seeing the rise of algorithmic anxiety, widespread crises of purpose, and deep social isolation, all symptoms of a world changing faster than our capacity to adapt.

              For a foundation focused on building a Culture of Health, this foresight provides both a moral and strategic imperative: to shift from merely patching the holes AI creates in our social fabric to proactively guiding innovation toward a future where our collective purpose is to build a wiser, more compassionate, and less pained world.
